 - Set Targets for Collectors -
 ------------------------------
 - GC Time Ratio
 - Max GC Pause Millis
 - Max HeapSize

 - â€‘XX:GCTimeRatio=99 -
 --------------------------
 - amount of work done vs time spent in GC
 
 - -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis -
 ------------------------------
 - Latency 
 - time taken by systems in responding to events which is impacted by pauses due to GC
 
 
 - Q - Does Hotspot achieve above targets ?
 
 - record life of object -
 ------------------------------
 - hotspot collector record via no of GC cycles survived
 
 - Frequent Minor Collections -
 --------------------------------
 - short lived objs r collected
 
 - Less Often Major Collections -
 ---------------------------------
 - older regions r collected
