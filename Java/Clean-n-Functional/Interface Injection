 - Useful w.r.t JIT -
 ---------------------------
 - JIT can ask the JVM whether the XXX implements the YYY interface. 
 - It then inlines the Interface Method call, it then has an excellent chance of inlining the ultimate call to
 - CCC or ZZZ or whatever. 
 
 - Injector Method -
 -------------------------
 - JVM defines this Injector Mthd .. 
 - Injector method would know the Class where the Mthd Behavior will be assigned
  
 - Injector Method -
 ------------------
 - may supply the missing implementations of interface Ops
 - these r supplied as a collection of Method Handles
 
 - Method Handles & Injector Method -
 ----------------------------------------
 - can be as fast as directly invoked ones
 
 - Useful to non-Java based langs -
 ----------------------------------------
 - Eacn JVM based lang can define its own metaobject, reusing the orig objs without modification
