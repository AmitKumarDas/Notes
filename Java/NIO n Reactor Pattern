 - Reactor -
 --------------
 - responds to IO events
 - & dispatches to the appropriate handler
 
 - Handlers - 
 ------------------
 - perform non-blockign actions
 - these have to be bind to the events
 
 - Reactor -to- NIO -
 -----------------------
 - Channel - support non blocking reads
 - Buffers - can be read or written by Channels
 - Selectors - tell which set of Channels have IO events
 - SelectionKeys - maintain IO event status & bindings
 
 - Tips - Build NIO Server -
 ----------------------------
 - ServerSocketChannel - on which we accept connections
 - Selector - which will be monitored
 - ByteBuffer - into which we'll read data when available
 - Selector - create one via SelectorProvider
 - ServerSocketChannel - open it
 - ServerSocketChannel - open -> configure -> bind -> register with selector
 - ServerSocketChannel - register selector with ACCEPT ing connection
 
 - Tips - Server Run -
 ----------------------
 - While Loop
 - Selector - select
 - Selectedkeys - Iterate
 - SelectedKey - Remove
 - Key - isValid ?
 - Key - isAcceptable ? or isReadable ?
 - Key - Accept Connection
 - Key - Read
 
 - Tips - Accept Conn -
 ----------------------------
 - get Server Socket Channel
 - get socket channel
 - configure blocking to false
 - register the selector with OP_READ
 
 - Tips - read -
 ----------------------
 - get SocketChannel
 - clear the read buffer
 - read from socketchannel to readbuffer
 - if properly read then close the channel
 - if properly read then cancel the key
 - if IOException then close the channel
 - if IOException then cancel the key
 - hand the read buffer to a worker thread
 
 - Tips - Worker -
 ---------------------
 - A runnable
 - uses a queue
 - Accepts data, channel, nio server & count of data
 - data is wrapped into an Event & pushed into the queue
 - queue is notified
 - run method runs in a loop
 - run method handles the data
 - run method writes to the server on response
 
 - Tips - Write Back to Server -
