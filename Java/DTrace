 - Pinning
 ------------------------
 - Performance problems are caused when an interrupt "steals" a CPU from an application thread, 
 - halting its process while the interrupt is serviced. 
 - This is called pinning - the interrupt will pin an application thread if the interrupt was delivered to a CPU
 - on which an application was executing at the time.
 
 Pinning & DTrace probes
 -------------------------
 - interrupt-start
 - interrupt-complete
 
 Pinning & Dtrace Scripts
 -----------------
 - get it online
 - they will give u below data
 - Drivers & their Pinned Processes
 - CPU consumption per process includes pinning per driver & time waiting on run queues
 - Interrupt routine name for a specified driver
 
 Resolving Pinning
 ------------------------
 - dedicate CPU to application that doesnot have high impact interrupts
 - dedicate CPU to drivers delivering high impact interrupts
 - better drivers.. drivers with worker threads, etc
 
 Pinning Issues in MultiThreaded App
 --------------------------------------
 - if multi threaded app is being pinned
 - check if any critical kernel or user lock r being held during pinning
 - use pinning dtrace probes with lock probes
 
 Locks & DTrace probes
 ----------------------
 - lockstat
 - plockstat
