 - Simplifies the wait & notify mechanism
 
 - Use Case - Various services are started in separate thread. 
   > You want to print a message iff all the services start successfully.

 - Solution - Create a CountDownLatch passing a value equal to the number of services to be monitored
   > Create Threads for each Service
   > Pass this latch during service creation, etc
   > Start the Threads which in turn will start the Services
   > Once each service has started successfully, countdown the latch
   > In your main thread do an await() 
   > Once the main thread code comes out of await() it means all services have started successfully

- Disadvantage of CountdownLatch
   > Cannot reuse the latch once the count == 0
   > Try CyclicBarrier for such requirements
