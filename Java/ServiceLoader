 - IOC / DI Framework
 ------------------------
 - Need not think of frameworks & libs
 - Check if u can use java.util.ServiceLoader
 
 
 ServiceLoader
 -------------------
 - java 6
 - loads i.e. instantiates based on flat files in META-INF/services
 - similar to NetBeans Lookup API though SL is a subset of Lookup
 
 Use of SL
 -------------
 - query for a type by providing Class object
 - get in return 0 or more instances which may be subclasses of that type
 - However, SL creates instances !!! Oh No
