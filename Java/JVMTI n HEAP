 - Object Tag -
 -------------------
 - A tag is a value associated with the Object
 - tags are not visible to other JVMTI environments
 - Tags are jlong values which can be used simply to mark an object or to store a pointer to more detailed information. 
 - Objects which have not been tagged have a tag of zero. Setting a tag to zero makes the object untagged.
 
 - Heap Callback Fn -
 -------------------------
 - Heap functions which iterate through the heap and recursively follow object references
 - Use agent supplied callback functions to deliver the information.
 - Must NOT use JNI funcs
 - must NOT use JVMTI funcs except callback safe funs
