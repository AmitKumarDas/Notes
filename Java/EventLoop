 RunLoop vs. EventLoop
 --------------------------
 - Its the same!!!
 - A method for checking whether there is a new event in the infinite loop, 
 - & calling an event handler when an event has been received. 
 
 Exact Threading Requirement
 -------------------------------
 - For Example - File searching on the server disk. 
 - In this case, it is better to create a separate thread for searching files. 
 
 Vert.x handles both of above
 ------------------------------
 - Vert.x creates Run Loops (Event Loops) equaling the number of cores &
 - provides thread pool-related function to handle tasks using server resources requiring long periods for event handling.
 
 Blocking vs Non Blocking
 ----------------------------
 - slect()/poll() - traditional POSIX poilling O(n)
 - epoll() - event based polling O(1), Linux 2.5.44+
 - kqueue  - FreeBSD, Mac OS X
 - I/O Completion Ports - Windows NT 3.5+, Solaris 10+
