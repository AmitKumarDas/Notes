 - Asynchronous -
 -----------------------
 - The mind shift comes in processing responses because there are none. 
 - Almost every single method invocation of substance is asynchronous, which means that there is no return value
 - The results (if there are any) will be delivered back in another thread.
 
 - Async Netty -
 -------------------
 - A fundamental benefit of NIO is that Selectors can be used to delegate the notification of events we are interested in
 - to the underlying operating system and at the root of it all, to the hardware we're running on.
 
 - Netty Channel -
 --------------------
 - abstraction over primitive byte arrays & NIO buffers
 - Your app may need more than buffers & byte arrays
 
 - Boss Threads -
 ----------------------
 - refer Reactor pattern
 - Boss threads create and connect/bind sockets and then pass them off to the worker threads. 
 - In the server, there is one boss thread allocated per listening socket. In the client, there is only one boss thread*
 
 - Worker Thread -
 -----------------------
 - refer Reactor pattern
 - perform all async IO ops
 
 Channels & Connection Types
 ---------------------------------
 - TCP NIO Channel - async comm
 - UDP NIO Channel - connection less
 - TCP OIO Channel - sync comm
 - UDP OIO Channel - async connection less
 
 

 Create HTTP Server
 ------------------------
 - Create a cached thread pool for incoming connections
 - Create a cached thread pool for processing IO
 - Provide a Channel Factory
 - Set up a Channel PipeLine Factory
 - Put all together with Bootstrap
 - Gather channels for future closing
 - Close gathered channels
 - release external resources
 
 - set TCP keepAlive -
 -------------------------
 - prolongs each TCP connection
 - makes NAT router happy
 
 - set TCP noDelay -
 ------------------------
 - glues small TCP packets
 - tries to reduce bandwidth
 - increases latency
 
 
 
 
 Writing Custom Handlers
 ---------------------------
 - Extend SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler
