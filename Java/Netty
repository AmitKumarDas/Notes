 - Asynchronous -
 -----------------------
 - The mind shift comes in processing responses because there are none. 
 - Almost every single method invocation of substance is asynchronous, which means that there is no return value
 - The results (if there are any) will be delivered back in another thread.
 
 - Async Netty -
 -------------------
 - A fundamental benefit of NIO is that Selectors can be used to delegate the notification of events we are interested in
 - to the underlying operating system and at the root of it all, to the hardware we're running on.
