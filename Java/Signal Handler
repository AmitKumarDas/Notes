 Usage of sun.misc.Signal
 ------- ------------- ---
 - trap OS signals
 - SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP
 
 Possible UseCases
 ------------------
 - instead of exiting JVM, reload config files
 - log them before passing to JVM's native handlers
 
 
 POSIX Signals
 ------------------
 - send sginals to running process
 
 Conventional Interrupt Handling
 --------------------
 - when interrupt occurs
 - processor simply stops executing the code
 - processor now jumps to an interrupt routine
 - environ of the interrupted process is saved
 - - CPU registers are saved
 - - processor status register are saved
 - This is known as Context Switch
 
 Context Switch
 --------------------
 - some h/w implement full context switch
 - if partial, then programmer needs to do the saving & restoration manually
 
 
 Scenarios
 -------------
 - Interrupts are events delivered to CPUs, usually by external devices (e.g. FC, SCSI, Ethernet and Infiniband adapters). 
 - Interrupts can cause performance and observability problems for applications.
 
 Interrupts & Performance Issues
 -----------------------------------
 - Performance problems are caused when an interrupt "steals" a CPU from an application thread, 
 - halting its process while the interrupt is serviced. 
 - This is called pinning - the interrupt will pin an application thread 
 - if the interrupt was delivered to a CPU on which an application was executing at the time.
 - This can affect other threads or processes in the application if for example the pinned thread 
 - - was holding one or more synchronization objects (locks, semaphores, etc.)
 
 Observing the Interrupt/Context Switch Issue
 -----------------------------------------------
 - If we are trying to account for work the application is completing versus the CPU it is consuming. 
 - During the time an interrupt has an application thread pinned, the CPU it consumes is charged to the application.
 
 DTrace Probes
 ------------------
 - interrupt-start
 - interrupt-complete
 - Can get the dtrace scripts to access the effect of pinning
