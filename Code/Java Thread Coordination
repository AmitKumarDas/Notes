A simple example referred from the article - http://jonasboner.com/publications/AOSD_2007_Final.pdf

This example shows the usage of wait/notify & synchronized blocks to ensure thread coordination.
This is not the recommended approach in modern days of Dataflows, STM & other channel based models.
However, just for old times sake, a simple example.

public class Counter {
  public final static Counter soleInstance = new Counter();
  private int value = 0;
  public void increment() {
    synchronized(this) {
      this.value++;
      notifyAll();
    }
  }

  public void waitFor(int expected) {
    synchronized(this) {
      while(this.value < expected) {
        try {
          wait();
        } catch(InterruptedException ex) {  }
      }
    }
  }
}

 Thread Coordination Optimization
 ---------------------------------
 - Need not go for synchronized
 - Synchronization is a read barrier on entry & write barrier on exit
 - Sometimes you need only a half-barrier
 - Volatiles can be used as half-barrier
 
 Thread Coordination Optimization
 ----------------------------------
 - Check if Atomic Integer,Long or Reference can be used ?
