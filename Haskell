LEARN HASKELL FAST + + + 

A Developer's Cookbook for the developer who knows Haskell but just wants to revise.

+ Cannot change state
+ is statically typed
+ is lazy .. does it refers to non-blocking .. could not get it !!!
+ STATICALLY TYPED - means - compiler knows which is string, which is number, etc
+ Type system can intelligently figure out if a number or string
+ was out in 2003 in a stable version 

+ GHC + + +
+ popular used compiler for Haskell

+ + + function call + +

div 92 10
or
92 `div` 10 //Note the backtick 


+ + On Fucntion Naming + + 
can start with lower case

-0-0-0 Infix Function -0-0-0-
+ funcs comprised of special chars
+ e.g. == + - /

0-0-0 What is => 0-0-0
+ => is called as class constraint

> :t (==)
> (==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool
-- equality func takes any 2 values
-- dat r of same type
-- & returns a Bool
-- a is of generics type
-- Eq is known as a typeclass 
-- typeclass == Interface in Java

+ + lists are homogenous
+ string is just a list of characters
+ So functions can be applied on strings effectively
+ [] , [[]], [[],[]] are different things
+ empty list, list containing empty list, list containing 2 empty lists
+ You can use : or ++ to concatenate lists
+ 

+ list comparison is done in a lexicographical order
[3,2,1] > [2,1,0]
> True

+ util functions on lists
+ head tail last init & so on
+ head ++ tail will give you the entire list
+ init ++ last will give you the entire list

+ BE CAREFUL OF EXCEPTIONS
+ when using functions on empty lists
+ 

+ Ranges + + 
[2,4..20]  
> [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]  

['K'..'Z']  
> "KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" 

+ + List Comprehension + + +
+ [x*2 | x <- [1..10]]  
> [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]  

+ + Predicate i.e. Conditions
+ [x*2 | x <- [1..10], x*2 >= 12]  
> [12,14,16,18,20] 

+ + Filtering via Predicate
+ boomBangs xs = [ if x < 10 then "BOOM!" else "BANG!" | x <- xs, odd x]
> boomBangs [7..13]  
> ["BOOM!","BOOM!","BANG!","BANG!"] 

+ + No More Iteration 
+ [ x*y | x <- [2,5,10], y <- [8,10,11], x*y > 50]  
> [55,80,100,110]  

+ + Temp or NoOp variable
+ length' xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs]
+ above is custom length implementation
+ _ represents the temp or noop variable

+ + remember list comprehension
+ removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c <- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']]
> removeNonUppercase "Hahaha! Ahahaha!"  
> "HA"  

+ + Tuples +
+ useful when you know how many values you want to combine
+ Tuple unlike List need not be HOMOGENOUS .. can have various types

+ + Tuples vs Lists 
+ Note - List can accept nested lists of uneven length
+ In Tuple its not possible...kind of a contract
+ 

0-0- Haskell Type 0-0
+ starts with a Caps

+ + Type Inference 
+ Is auto Infer
+ :t is used to determine type
+ :t 'a'  
>'a' :: Char 

+ + Defining function with types is GOOD
removeNonUppercase :: [Char] -> [Char]  
removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c <- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']] 

factorial :: Integer -> Integer  
factorial n = product [1..n]

+ + Type Variables i.e. Generics
+ :t fst  //determine what type if fst
> fst :: (a, b) -> a 
> Here a & b are in small case. hence not a Type & a Generic Type


+ + Typeclasses i.e. Java Interface & more
+ Defines the behavior
