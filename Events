Thought of putting together Events as defined & used in various languages/frameworks together.

+ + In JavaScript + + 
------------------------------------

element.addEventListener(event, handler, useCapture);
+ setting useCapture to false; means capture the event on bubbling than on capture phase
+ setting usecapture to false; you will be fine in most of the cases
+ lots o interesting properties comes in with the argument event
+ use event.currentTarget than `this` keyword
> coz, this may be bound to something else

+ + Event Delegation
+ Add event handler to an element & get all of its child elements for free
+ event handler is expensive to the browser, so event delegation is GOOD

+ + CSS Transitions & Animations
+ have their own events
+ CSS transition fire a single event called transitionend
+ CSS animation events have animationstart, animationend & animationiteration

+ + Many More ...
+ Media have their events too
+ Device Orientation, Touch Events, postMessage, pageVisibility, history Events
