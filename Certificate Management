0-0-0 SAML Signing 0-0-0
+ IDP sends a signed SAML assertion using its private key
+ Signature can include the X.509 (public key) certificate
+ This public key is Base64 encoded before being included in the signature
+ Signed assertions will be Validated by the trusting party

0-0-0 Server Authentication 0-0-0
+ If SSL is configured at the server only then it is termed as Server Authentication
+ To enable Server Auth, you need to ::
> STEP 1 - Create a public/private key pair
> STEP 2 - Obtain  a certificate
+ This cert is known as Server Certificate or Personal Certificate
+ This cert is used by the Server to authenticate itself to the client

0-0-0 What does the client do in case of Server Authentication 0-0-0
+ Client will obtain the cert of the CA that issued the server cert
+ The client maintains a list of trusted issuers
+ Client will add CA certificate to that list

0-0-0 Who Stores the certs 0-0-0
+ Private keys & Personal Certs are stored in KeyStores
+ Public Keys & CA certs are stored oin TrustStores
+ 

0-0-0 On Encryption at SAML 0-0-0
+ Use partner's Public Key to encrypt
+ This Public Key will correspond to the partner's Private key
+ Partner will use its Private Key to decrypt

0-0-0 Different SAML Signing Requirements 0-0-0
+ Message can be signed
+ Assertion can be signed
+ Use can use same or different keys for signing Message & Assertion
+ Above is applicable only for SAML 2.0

0-0-0 Password protection 0-0-0
+ Private/Personal keys in a keystore can be encrypted by a password
+ The KeyStore is also protected by a password
+ 

-0- private key & public cert as 2 files -0-
+ They received it as 2 separate files, a .crt file with the certificate, and a .key file with the private key. 
+ We are trying to combine these files into a .pfx file to import into the Certificate Store.
>> openssl -in a.crt -inkey a.key -export -out a.pfx
>> import the .pfx output file from the command above into Internet Explorer, 
>> and then export it from IE with the private key and all of the CA certificates in the certification chain. 
>> The resulting exported .pfx from IE would then successfully import into the Certificate Store.
