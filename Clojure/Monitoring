Meanwhile, I am trying to find out the best JVM language that can monitor things like Erlang does.

Even though I am yet to understand why Erlang is best in this.

I feel, above concepts i.e. strengths of the particular JVM language can be applied for
- automated deployment/migration/upgrade
- distributed session management
- HA solutions
