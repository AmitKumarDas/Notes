 -0 What is Messaging
--------------------------
  > producers
  > broker
  > consumers
  > can be without a broker - ref ZeroMQ

 -0 ZeroMQ Compared With
--------------------------
  > SCTP + JGroups = make arbitrary networks using 'brokerless' peers
  > SCTP - Messaginig
  > JGroups - pub sub
 
 -0 Why SCTP - Stream Control Transmission Protocol
--------------
  -0 Limitations of TCP
-------------------------
  > strict order of transmission delivery of data
  > head-of-line blocking offered by TCP causes unnecessary delay
  > Applications must add their own record marking to delineate their messages, 
  >> and must make explicit use of the push facility to ensure that a complete message is transferred.
  > The limited scope of TCP sockets complicates the task of providing highly-available data transfer 
  >> capability using multi-homed hosts.
  > TCP is relatively vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, such as SYN attacks.

  -0 Features woth SCTP
--------------------------
  > multi-homing support on both ends
  >> multi-homing = consist of more than one IP address
  >> enabling transparent failover between redundant network paths
  > multi stream - delivery of chunks with independent streams
  > validation & acknowledgement mechanisms protect against flooding attacks
  > provide notification of duplicated or missing data chunks
  > simpler packet structure than TCP
  > Security - 4 way handshake to protect against SYN flooding
  >> protect against large cookies for association verification & authenticity
  > Not supported directly in Windows
