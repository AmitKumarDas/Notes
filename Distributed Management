 -0 Performance Aspects
---------------------------
  > should perform in large distributed systems
  > 

 -0 Reliability Aspects
---------------------------
  > avoid single point of failure
  > 

 -0 Synchronization Aspects
------------------------------
  > support synchronous as well as sync
  > support events
  > support heartbeats
  > 


 -0 Monitoring Aspects
-------------------------
  > if Read request registers a watch that watch is tracked locally @ the server
  > 

 -0 In-Memory data
---------------------------
  > achive high throughput & low latency
  > by avoiding disk I/O
  > downside - size of database is limited by memory

 -0 Clustered In-memory data
-----------------------------
  > in a clustered environ, the db could be partitioned
  > then replicated into segments
  > & stored in main memory of several nodes
  > 

 -0 Centralized Server
--------------------------
  > clients connect to a Single server
  > if client to server connection breaks, client will connect to a different server
  > session will get restablished in the new server

 -0 Request Types
---------------------------------------
  > support multiple request types
  > Read, Write, Sync
  > Read requests are processed locally to which the client is connected
  > Write requests are forwarded to other servers & go through a consensus before a response is generated
  > Sync requests are forwarded to other servers but do not go through consesus
  > throughput of read requests scales with no of servers
  > throughput of write requests decrease with no of servers
  > All updates are ordered

 -0 Centralized Metadata Management
----------------------------------------
  > store coordinate data
  > store status info
  > location info

 -0 Replication
----------------------
  > replicate on create
  > replicate on faliure
