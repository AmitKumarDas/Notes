 Closure - What is it ?
 -------------------------
 - code block executed at a later time
 - looks similar to Lambda in Java
 
 - Example -
 ---------------
 
 def localMethod() {
  def localVariable = new java.util.Date()
  return { println localVariable }
 }

 def clos = localMethod()

 println "Executing the Closure:"
 clos() //prints the date when "localVariable" was defined
 
 
 - Example -
 ----------------
 - this, delegate & owner
 - delegate is same as owner but is changeable
 
 class Class1 {
  def closure = {
    println this.class.name
    println delegate.class.name
    def nestedClos = {
      println owner.class.name
    }
    nestedClos()
  }
 }

 def clos = new Class1().closure
 clos.delegate = this
 clos()
 /*  prints:
  Class1
  Script1
  Class1$_closure1  */
