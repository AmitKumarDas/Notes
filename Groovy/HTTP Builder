 Redirects
 --------------
 - In cases where a response sends a redirect status code, 
 - this is handled internally by Apache HttpClient, 
 - which by default will simply follow the redirect by re-sending the request to the new URL. 
 - You do not need to do anything special in order to follow 302 responses.
