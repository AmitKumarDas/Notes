- Http Builder
- JMX Builder


 - Why Builder -
 -----------------
 - Developers get stuck with creating Data Structures,
 - stuck with domain classes
 - stuck with creating XML
 - stuck with creating Output Streams etc...
 - remember using the DOM API to build XML docs... Its nasty
 
 - XML - 
 def builder = new groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder(writer)
   builder.teacher (name: "Jones") {
      student (name: "Bob") {}  
      student (name: "Sue") {}
   }
 
 
 o/p

 <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <teacher name = "Jones">
    <student name = "Bob">
    <student name = "Sue">
  </teacher>
