GNOME Desktop Environment

    A server seldomly needs a full-blown desktop environment. In case a graphical environment is needed, a more economical solution such as as icewm or fvwm may also be sufficient. 
X Window System

    When solely administrating the server and its applications via command line, consider to not install this pattern. However, keep in mind that it is needed to run GUI applications from a remote machine. If your application is managed by a GUI or if you prefer the GUI version of YaST, keep this pattern.
