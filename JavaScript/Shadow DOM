 - Shadow DOM subtrees
 --------------------------
 - Shadow DOM allows a single node to express three subtrees: 
 - light DOM, 
 - shadow DOM, and 
 - composed DOM.
 
 All DOMS
 -------------
 - A component user supplies the light DOM; 
 - the node has a (hidden) shadow DOM; 
 - and the composed DOM is what is actually rendered in the browser. 
 - At render time, the light DOM is merged with the shadow DOM to produce the composed DOM.
