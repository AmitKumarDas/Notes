 <template>
 -----------
 - The HTML Template element is new and browsers are in the process of implementing it. 
 - It allows you to declare fragments of HTML that may be used at some point. 

 MDV & <template>
 ----------------
 - However, the MDV library teaches <template> some new tricks. 
 - With MDV, <template> knows how to
 - - Instruct DOM nodes to derive their value from JavaScript data by binding them to the data provided.
 - - Maintain a fragment of DOM (or “instance fragment”) for each item in an array.
 - - Conditionally stamp out one or more instance fragments, based on whether some data value is true or not.
