 Whats asm.js
 -----------------
 - stripped down version
 - a subset of JS
 
 What asm does
 ---------------
 - converts the native code into above JavaScript
 
 Is JS VM faster ?
 ------------------
 - V8 & Nitro suggests so
 - achieve via the JIT
 - V8 converts JS into pieces of executable code dat the CPU could run directly
 
 How come fast ?
 -------------------
 - C/C++ the behavior of the program is baked in when the program is compiled
 - so good for optimization & hence performance
 - so ASM doesnot support JS' OO constructs
 - ASM doesnot support JS dynamic capabilities
 - asm.js programs manipulate a large array representing "memory" 
 
 C++ Object & Memory
 -----------------------
 - In a C++ program, an object in memory is typically represented by the memory address of the class's v-table 
 - A table of all the functions belonging to the object's class
 - followed by the storage for the object's data.
 
 ASM.js & Memory
 -----------------
 - So too in asm.js: the memory array would contain, in consecutive elements, 
 - the array index of the v-table and
 - then the object data.
