  > SASL is used by app protocols like IMAP, POP & XMPP
  > effect is to modularize authentication, s.t. newer authentication mechanisms can be added as needed

-0- STS & SAML Assertion
-------------------------
  > SAMLAssertion's Subject's confirmation methods can be correlated with STS
  > subject confirmation methods are not defined in SAML core
  > SAML Profile specs define the below 3 subject confirmation methods
  > > Holder Of Key (HOK)
  > > Bearer
  > > Send Vouches (SV)

-0- SAML & Web Services
--------------------------
  > standardized in the context of SAML token profile

-0- WS Security Policy UseCases
----------------------------------
  > http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/security-policy/examples/ws-sp-usecases-examples.html

-0- WS-Trust STS
---------------------
  > introduces a runtime component called STS
  > STS will act as an intermediary between SP & IDP
  > this has advantages to the direct trust relationship between SP & IDP
  > STS can issue tokens based on requirements from IDP &/or SP
  > > requirements of IDP are specified in a WS-Policy or out of band agreement

-0- STS & Web Service Consumer
--------------------------
  > consumer need not know various types of token required by IDP
  > web service consumer sends request to STS providing the requirements of the client as well as IDP
  > once consumer receives token from STS, it attaches the same to outgoing SOAP message meant for IDP

-0- STS jargon - TokenType

 -0 Understanding Mutual SSL Types
----------------------------------
  > mutual SSL through Proxy without a tunnel may be good
  > mutual SSL via a tunnel may not be clean
