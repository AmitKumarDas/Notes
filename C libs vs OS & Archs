 Compression Lib
 -------------------
 - On POSIX systems it's named libz.so and usually comes pre-installed.
 - On Windows it's named zlib1.dll
 
 zlib
 ------
 - zlib API uses the long type for passing lengths and sizes around. 
 - But all those zlib functions actually only deal with 32 bit values.
 
 
 long
 -------
 - A long is a 64 bit type e.g. on POSIX/x64 systems, 
 - but a 32 bit type on Windows/x64 and on 32 bit systems. 
 - Thus a long result can be either a plain Lua number or a boxed 64 bit integer cdata object, 
 - depending on the target system
