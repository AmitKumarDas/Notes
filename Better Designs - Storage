Data Transfer can be done in any of three modes:
   
> Stream mode: Data is sent as a continuous stream, 
          Relieving FTP from doing any processing. 
          Rather, all processing is left up to TCP. 
          No End-of-file indicator is needed, unless the data is divided into records.

> Block mode: FTP breaks the data into several blocks 
          (block header, byte count, and data field) and then passes it on to TCP.

> Compressed mode: Data is compressed using a single algorithm (usually run-length encoding).
