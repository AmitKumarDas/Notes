    > DONT just add & keep quiet

An Observable can subscribe a list of Callbacks & return a Subscription.
    > writing style talks of <code>subscribe</code> as a method in Observable
    > In theory, callbacks subscribe an Observable

Thread Safe Wrappers

   > ensures unsubscription happens only once
 
A Thread Safe Observer
