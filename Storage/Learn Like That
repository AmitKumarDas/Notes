 - list processes on VM w.r.t KVM -
 -----------------------------------
 - ps aux | grep kvm

 - KVM Virtual Machine - made of -
 ---------------------------------
 - files in a directory
 - ls -al <put the path .. refer to ps aux command>
 
 - One of KVM with OpenStack's Nova files - libvirt.xml  -
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 - same as .vmx file in vmware

 - XenServer & Storage -
 <====================================================>
 
 - XenServer Host API - to perform storage related tasks
 - SR - Storage Repository - a Container
 - VDI - Virtual Disk Image - contains the contents of a Virtual Disk
 - SR & VDI abstractions - good for advanced storage features
 - SR Types - depends on H/W types - local or remote
 - SR Types - local -> IDE, SATA, SCSI, SAS drives
 - SR Types - remote -> iSCSI, NFS, Fibre Channel
 - Each XenServer Host - can use multiple SRs
 - Each XenServer Host - can use different SRs
 - SRs - can be dedicated to a Host
 - SRs - can be shared between Hosts
 - Shared SR must be network accessible
 - Network accessible SR - must be iSCSI, NFS, NetApp or FibreChannel SR
 - VDI types - VHD, LVM, NetApp managed LUNs
 - Virtual Hard Disk - specs from Microsoft
 - LVM - Logical Volume Manager
 - VHD Images - extra metadata & chaining info - Hence less performant against LVM
 - SRs contain homogenous Virtual Disk Images
 - SR - a persistent - on-disk datastructure
 - SR - creating a new -> kinda formatting a disk
 - PBD - Physical Block Devices
 - PBD - interface betwn Physical Host & attached SR
 - PBD - has the config/IP/path - of storage target & Host - *
 - PBD Objects - manage runtime attachment of a given SR to a given XenServer Host - *
 - VDI - persistent - can exist independently of Host
 - VDI - fundamental unit of virtualized Storage in XenServer
 - VBD - Virtual Block Device
 - VBD - can attach a VDI to a VM
 - VBD - fine tuning of QoS & bootability of a given VDI
 - low level storage management - python scripts - /opt/xensource/sm
 - SR - r implemented as Python scripts
 - New SR Impls - Can be placed in above directory & XenServer should be able to detect them
 - XenServer <-> NFS Server - via NFS V3 over TCP/IP .. for storing VDIs on shared network attached SR
 - Modify contents of SR directory -> risk of corrupting contents of VDIs
 - NFS server must be configured to export the specified path to all XenServer Host in the pool
 - Prior to this NFS server IP must be provided & sr-probe will list the available destination paths
 - XenServer use non-volatile RAM to provide fast acknowledgments of write requests 
 -- while maintaining a high degree of data protection from failure. 
 - Shared SRs - via - iSCSI LUNs
 - Shared iSCSI SRs - support VM agility - using XenMotion
 - iSCSI initiators & targets - must have unique name to be identified on the network
 - iSCSI initiator & target addresses - colelctively - called IQNs
 - iSCSI IQNs - iSCSI Qualified Names
 - iSCSI single initiator - can connect to multiple iSCSI targets concurrently
 - IQN - Access Control - Maintained in Initiator IQNs & Target IQNs
 - If no Access Control - target IQN will restrict to a single initiator IQN
