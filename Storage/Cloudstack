 Parts
 -----------
 - 2 parts
 - management server
 - cloud infra (storage, network, IPs, hosts)
 
 Mngmt Server
 ----------------
 - runs on Tomcat & uses MySQL for persistence
 
 Mgmnt Server Manages
 ------------------------
 - allocated VMs to hosts
 - assigns public & private IPs
 - allocates Storage
 - manages snapshots, templates & ISOs...their replication
 
 
 Cloud Insfra
 --------------
 - Zone: Typically, a zone is equivalent to a single datacenter. 
 - A zone consists of one or more PODS and secondary storage.
 - Pod: A pod is usually 1 RACK of HARDWARE that includes a LAYER-2 SWITCH and 1 or MORE CLUSTERS.
 - Cluster: A cluster consists of one or more hosts and primary storage.
 - Host: A single compute node within a cluster. 
 
 
 POD
 ---------
 - 1 HW -> L-2 Switch < cluster1 & 2 ...

 Host
 ----------
 - The hosts are where the actual cloud services run in the form of guest virtual machines.
 - Primary storage is associated with a cluster, 
 - - and it stores the disk volumes for all the VMs running on hosts in that cluster.
 - Secondary storage is associated with a zone, and it stores templates, ISO images, and disk volume snapshots.

 Layer-2 Switch
 -----------------------
 - hardware based
 - uses MAC address from hosts' NICs to foward 
 - MAC - Media Access Cotrol
 - Network Interface Card
 
 Why Layer - 2
 -----------------
 - h/w based bridging
 - wire speed, high speed, low latency
 

 - Basic. Networking
 ----------------------
 -> For AWS-style networking. 
 -> Provides a single network where guest isolation can be provided through layer-3 means such as security groups 
 -> (IP address source filtering).
 
 - Advanced. Networking
 -----------------------
 -> For more sophisticated network topologies. 
 -> This network model provides the most flexibility in defining guest networks.

 Cluster
 ----------
 - groups hosts
 - = Xen server pool
 - = a set of KVM servers
 - = VMware cluster
 
 Hosts in a Cluster
 ----------------------
 - have identical h/w
 - run the same hypervisor
 - are on the same subnet
 - access the same shared principal storage
 
 Hosts in a Cluster
 ---------------------
 - can be LIVE migrated from one host to another, without interrupting service
 
 Secondary Storage
 --------------------
 - is associated with a zone
 - stores Templates, ISOs, Snapshots
 
 NFS alone Architecture
 -----------
 - copy templates & snapshots from one zone to another
 
 Swift & NFS - Architecture
 ---------------
 - Swift for entire cloudstack
 - NFS as secondary storage
 - Swift itself acts as a cloud wide resource
 - Swift makes the templates & other data available to any zone in the cloud
 - Just 1 swift Container per storage object
 - Everything is available everywhere
 
 - Primary Storage -
 ----------------------------
 - shared storgae across a cluster
 - e.g. Cluster LVM...iSCSI
 - holds disk images of running VMs
 
 - Secondary Storage -
 -------------------------
 - across zone .. can use swift or any object store .. holds snapshots & templates
