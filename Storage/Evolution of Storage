 - Storage Provisoning -
 ------------------------------
 - Is not same as server provisoning i.e. server virtualization
 
 - Storage Virtualization in Legacy Storage -
 ----------------------------------------------
 - is often internal, meaning it is isolated to a single system and a single manufacturer.
 
 - Legacy Storage Virtualization - Issue -
 ---------------------------------------------
 - multiple storage virtualization software instances running as each system from each manufacturer has its own software
 - The CSP/MSP typically has a wide collection of storage hardware.
 - Hence, this leads to a different brand hypervisor loaded on every server and having to manage each of those separately.
 
 - Legacy Storage Virtualization - Lacks Intelligence -
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 - It cannot MAP an APP type w.r.t Storage Media Type
 - i.e. a high performing app will do good with a particular media type, etc.
 
 - Provisioning != Physical Capacity
 -------------------------------------
 - Other Storage Resources r also IMP
 - Storage CPU, Storage Controller Memory, Internal Cache Management and network bandwidth
 
 - Ok so IF ALL Above r Provisoned ?
 ---------------------------------------------
 - Combination & Control of these resources
 == amount of IOPS or throughput and storage latency that a storage system can deliver
 - Now deliver the IOPs w.r.t an app or server
 
 - Self-Serviced Provisioning -
 ----------------------------------------
 - delegate provisioning to the account while maintaining oversight
 - This means allocating a certain amount of capacity and IOPS/throughput/latency per account 
 - and then allowing the account to divide up those services based on need.
 
 - Self Monitoring -
 ----------------------
 - Account wants to know how much he is using on which application at what time. 
 - This will help them to better manage their applications running at a CSP/MSP
 
 
 - Storage Services other than Provisioning -
 --------------------------------------------
 - Thin Provisioning, Snapshots, Cloning and Replication, across multiple storage platforms, 
 -- even those from different vendors.
 
 
 - Elastic Provisioning -
 ----------------------------
 - Deploy a series of off the shelf servers to act as physical storage controllers. 
 - The storage in the environment (physical storage != storage controllers) is then assigned to storage controllers. 
 - Since these controllers are abstracted from the physical storage they can manage a mixed storage vendor environment.
 
 - Virtual Controller -
 ------------------------------
 - very similar to virtual server in hypervisor
 - An account is assigned to each of the Virtual Controller
 - Capacity and IOPS/Throughput/Latency, based on the needs of the account, are then assigned to the virtual controller.
 - The account can then sub-divide the capacity and SLA parameters based on the needs of each of its applications. 
 - However, there is no isolation within apps of a single account
 
 - Think Enterprise -
 ------------------------------
 - Enterprise can achieve the same what CSP will be able to
 - Every LOB (similar to Account) can be assigned a Virtual Storage Controller
 - The enterprise also has a mix of storage systems and could benefit from a centralized controller cluster.
 
 - Security -
 --------------------
 - Storage is encrypted between virtual controllers so that one subscriber cannot read another subscriber’s data.
 - With the CloudByte solution, even the provider can't read the individual subscriber’s data since 
 -- the keys are held at the subscriber level
 
 - Legacy Way -
 ------------------------
 - hardwire storage controller & disk to meet a desirable performance
 
 - Cloudbyte Nodes -
 ---------------------------
 - Intelligent storage nodes, where each storage endpoint/volume is defined in terms of IOPS, throughput, and latency, 
 - in addition to capacity.
 
 - CLoudbyte Provisioning -
 ----------------------------
 - Automated provisioning - determine the right storage node and storage pool, 
 -- which can deliver the required storage performance and capacity.
 
 - IOPS && Throughput && Latency -
 ------------------------------------------------
 - Host a database application, a video streaming application and an email application on the same storage platform
