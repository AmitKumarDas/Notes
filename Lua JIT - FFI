 - Lua JIT FFI
 -----------------
 - The FFI library largely obviates the need to write tedious manual Lua/C bindings in C.
 - Calls to C functions can be inlined in JIT-compiled code, 
 - - unlike calls to functions bound via the classic Lua/C API. 
 
 Lua JIT FFI - How
 ------------------
 - Just load the ffi library in lua code
 - define the C method
 - execute the C method as if it were a Lua method
 
 
 Lua JIT FFI - C DataStructures
 ---------------------------------
 - Lua is built upon high-level data types. 
 - They are flexible, extensible and dynamic. That's why we all love Lua so much. 
 - Alas, this can be inefficient for certain tasks, where you'd really want a low-level data type. 
 - E.g. a large array of a fixed structure needs to be implemented 
 - - with a big table holding lots of tiny tables. 
 - This imposes both a substantial memory overhead as well as a performance overhead. 
 
 -> So just declare the C DataStructurein Lua using FFI.
 -> This C DataStructure will have the minimal type e.g. uint8_t
 
 Lua JIT - Coolness
 ---------------------
 - Stop learning C / CPP syntaxes
 - Stop worrying memory leaks
 - Look @ the C header files or the documentation provided by each C library or C compiler.
 - That's it.
 
 FFI - Inside Details
 --------------------
 - The FFI library provides the ffi.C default C library namespace, 
 - which allows calling functions from the default set of libraries, like a C compiler would. 
 - Also, the FFI library automatically detects stdcall functions, so you don't need to declare them as such.
