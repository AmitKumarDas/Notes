 - ListenerThread & WorkerTask of ApiServer
 - completely dedicated to integration port or OTW requests.
 - Can we remove Tomcat altogether & use integration port to handle all kinds of requests.
 - How about establishing trust/security etc
 - Does CB expose itself to the api port without any security ?
 - Does CB utilize the api port at all ?
