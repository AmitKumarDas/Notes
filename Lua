  Tables
-----------
  > associative array
  > can be indexed with nos as well as strings
  > only data structuring mechanism in Lua
  > are objects... not variables or values  
  > when a prog has no references to the table, Lua mem management will delete that mem & reuse its memory  

  Packages
-------------
  > Lua uses Tables to represent Packages
  > io.read -> 'read' key from 'io' table
  
  Constructor Expression
--------------------------
  > {}
  > You cannot declare a table
  > you can only create one via {}

 Lua Environment
 -----------------
 - C extensions tie LUA interpreter to hardware & O/S commands
